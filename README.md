Few years ago as a part of Mobile Development Course at McGill University I've followed the text book to create this app, using the ADT, here I've uploaded the Android Studio version, then updated again to 2.0
The app demonstrates how to create and wire up a button in Android, also demos using intents to navigate to another Activity.
